# WebGPIO
It is a web service and a client library that allows to control electronic components connected to an IoT device (like a Raspberry-Pi) from anywhere just using a web browser.
It was built using WebSockets for the communications and allows to easily map remote hardware events to web page events by embedding a small script.

For example, you can switch on the heating in your home from your smartphone or get a notification immediately when the main door opens.
